# Interpretation of model's statistics of binary logistic regression in SAS 4GL and the SAS Enterprise Guide tool
### Author: Adrian Å»elazek

The aim of the project is to analyze individual statistics resulting from building a model of binary logistic regression concerning obesity. It should be emphasized that the aim of this project is only an analysis and interpretation of the obtained results, and not to build the best model.  

### The programming language and tool
* SAS 4GL
* SAS Enterprise Guide

### Actions performed and interpreted
* Data Acquisition
* Coding of quality variables
* Deviation and Pearson statistics
* Akaike and Schwarz fitting statistics
* Testing the global null hypothesis
* Susceptibility testing of individual variables
* Analysis of maximum reliability ratings
* Combination of predicted probabilities and observed responses
* Wald's parameter ratings and confidence intervals with interpretation of the results
* Wald's chance quotients and confidence intervals with interpretation of results
* Chance quotient chart with Wald's 95% confidence interval
* ROC curve for the model
* Hosmer and Lemeshow compatibility test
